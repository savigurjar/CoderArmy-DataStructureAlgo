# 🧠 Introduction to Computing & Number Systems

This lecture introduces the evolution of computing, number systems used historically and in modern computers, and why Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) are essential for solving real-world problems efficiently.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### ✅ Introduction of Course and Instructor

A quick welcome to the course, overview of what will be taught, and an introduction to the instructor’s background and teaching style.

---

### 🪨 History of Human Counting (Using Stones)

Humans initially counted physical items like sheep using stones or marks. This primitive method laid the foundation for number systems and the development of arithmetic.

---

### 🏺 Egyptian Number System: Base 60, Decimal, and Arithmetic

Ancient civilizations like Egypt and Babylon used unique number systems. Egypt used a decimal system, while Babylon used base-60. Understanding these systems helps explain the origin of time units (60 minutes/hour) and geometry (360° circle).

---

### 🖥️ Evolution of Computers

Covers the timeline of how computers evolved — from mechanical devices like abacuses and Charles Babbage’s engines to modern digital computers using silicon chips and microprocessors.

---

### 🔌 Transistors

A fundamental hardware component used to build logic gates in computers. Transistors act as switches that represent binary states (0 and 1), crucial for performing computations.

---

### 💡 Binary Number System

Binary (base-2) is the core language of computers. It uses only 0 and 1 to represent all numbers and instructions, aligning perfectly with the on-off state of transistors.

---

### 🔄 Decimal to Binary Conversion

Explanation and techniques to convert base-10 (human-readable) numbers to base-2 (machine-readable) format.

---

### 🔁 Binary to Decimal Conversion

The reverse of the above — converting binary values back to decimal, helping us interpret what computers are processing.

---

### 🧮 Introduction to Octal and Hexadecimal Systems

Octal (base-8) and Hexadecimal (base-16) are compact ways to represent binary data. They are especially useful in memory addressing and color codes in computing.

---

### 🔟 Hexadecimal System in Detail

Further exploration of hexadecimal: how it works, why it’s useful (e.g., 1 hex digit = 4 binary digits), and where it's used in programming and computer systems.

---

### ⚙️ How Transistors Work (Binary vs Decimal Interpretation)

Illustrates how computers interpret instructions via transistors. They only understand on/off states (binary), not decimal, which is why binary is used internally.

---

### 📈 Moore’s Law

Observation that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles about every 18-24 months, increasing computational power exponentially while reducing cost.

---

### 🖥️ Machine Language

The lowest-level programming language consisting of binary instructions directly executed by the CPU. Very difficult for humans to write or debug.

---

### 🧾 Assembler

A program that converts human-readable assembly language into machine language. Acts as a bridge between low-level programming and hardware.

---

### 💻 High-Level Programming Languages

Languages like Python, Java, and C++ that are easier for humans to understand. These are eventually translated to machine code via compilers or interpreters.

---

### 📊 Data in Real-Life Examples

Real-world data examples (e.g., personal info, transactions, sensor data) demonstrate how data is collected, stored, and processed for useful insights.
